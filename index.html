                    <h3>Tricube Tales</h3>
                    <p>I just picked up a rule-lite roleplaying game called <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/294202/Tricube-Tales">Tricube Tales</a>. It's great for a quick session, running an adventure for kids, or a solo adventure.</p>

                    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                    <p>I bounce between interests often and this is a list of a few of my current hobbies.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dungeons and Dragons</li>
                        <li>Arkham Horror the Cardgame</li>
                        <li>Reading Sci/Fi and Fantasy</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>At any given time that list is likely to be roughly the same size, maybe with one or two items the same, but invariably there will be something new there. Check back in January and I'm sure things will have changed.
                    <p>Even though the list changes every few months, if you wait long enough, you'll see the same list items come and go, over and over again. While my interests cycle they seem to revolve around the same topics. My interest in any given topic wanes and waxes over time.</p>
                    <p>I have ADHD and I'm sure that has a lot to do with the revolving door of interests.</p>
